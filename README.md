This library was written entirely by **MarsSquirrel**. This library is free for reproduction and the liscense can be found within this repo. This library was made to show off my Machine Learning w/ Mincraft stuff. I'm sharing this with the world because I feel as if it's more easier for people to understand this simple library. I am in no way a Machine Learning expert!
