This library was written entirely by **MarsSquirrel**. This library is free for reproduction and the liscense can be found within this repo. Also, this library is custom made to support high density applications for my personal projects. I'm sharing this with the world because I feel as if it's more easier for people to understand this simple library. I am in no way a Machine Learning expert!
